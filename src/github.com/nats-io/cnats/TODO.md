- [ ] Expand on the use of nats_setError
- [ ] Revisit Flusher for the aggregation of more data before socket write
- [ ] Decide if we go full non-blocking sockets, so we can apply deadline to all read/writes
- [x] Plug with async/IO event libraries (such as libevent/libuv)
- [x] Make sure Inboxes are really unique (use of srand + seq for now)
- [x] SSL/TLS
- [x] Pooling/garbage collection of structures ~~(may add more later, and pool msgs structures and buffers, but that would introduce locking which may negate the benefits of the pooling)~~
- [x] ~~Revisit connect logic to match GO Client~~ *Will actually do the opposite, that is change the GO Client connect/reconnect logic. The async reconnect logic is flawed and could cause issues when getting authentication errors during the process.*
- [x] Revisit FlushTimeout to match GO Client
- [x] Improve Request/Reply performance (*Solved by doing explicit flushing after sending the reply. The original performance issue is due to the way the flusher is implemented, whereby we sleep a millisecond to accumulate more work. So that limited the rate to 1000 messages/sec*).
- [x] Port for Linux (~~may work as-is~~, need to check)
- [x] Port for Windows ~~+ Makefile~~ *(Use CMake for cross-platform support)
- [x] Some tests are not ported because they require a mockup server
